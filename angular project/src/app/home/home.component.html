            <h3>Wastee connects you with your neighbors so that you can easily share your excess food instead of throwing it away. What do you need to do? You just need to add photo, title, description, and price of food. You can also share your food at free of cost. Any nearby buyer will review your food then send you an offer. If you satisfy with buyer's offer then you can accept his/her offer or you can also counter the offer. You can negotiate for the food you are interested in and make a deal at a price convenient to both the persons. You can chat with your buyers and with live tracking buyers can directly pick up the food. It's so quite simple. You can also subscribe to add more food products. So Wastee works like a food flea market around the corner where you can easily share your any waste food.</h3>
